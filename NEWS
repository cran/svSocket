== Changes in svSocket 0.9-43
* Polishing package for CRAN submission

== Changes in svSocket 0.9-42
* Made compatible with R 2.6.x (previous package was R >= 2.7.0).

== Changes in svSocket 0.9-41

* Correction in startSocketServer(): the SocketServerProc function was not
  protected against garbage collection. Consequently, the socket server stopped
  working at unpredictable events.

* Correction of a bug preventing processSocket() to display error messages.
  Instead, I got:
    Error in ngettext(1, "Error: ", domain = "R") :
      argument "msg2" is missing, with no default

== Changes in svSocket 0.9-40

This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (Tinn-R is also supported, but not SciViews-R Console any more).

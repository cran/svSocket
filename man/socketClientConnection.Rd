\usage{
socketClientConnection(
  client,
  serverport = 8888,
  socket,
  blocking = FALSE,
  open = "a",
  encoding = getOption("encoding")
)

\method{summary}{sockclientconn}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{client}{the client identification. By default, it is the socket
identifier as it appears in \code{\link[=getSocketClients]{getSocketClients()}}. The client must be
currently connected.}

\item{serverport}{the port on which the server is running, 8888 by default.
This server must be currently running.}

\item{socket}{the Tcl socket name where the targeted client is connected. If
not provided, it will be guessed from \code{client}, otherwise, \code{client} is
ignored.}

\item{blocking}{logical. Should the connection wait that the data is written
before exiting?}

\item{open}{character. How the connection is opened. Currently, only \code{"a"}
for append (default) or \code{"w"} for write access are usable.}

\item{encoding}{the name of the encoding to use.}

\item{object}{A 'sockclientconn' object as returned by
\code{\link[=socketClientConnection]{socketClientConnection()}}.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to the method (not used for the moment).}
}
\value{
\code{\link[=socketClientConnection]{socketClientConnection()}} creates a 'sockclientconn' object redirects text
send to it to the SciViews socket server client. It is inherits from a
'sockconn' object (see \code{socketConnection()}), and the only difference is that
output is redirected to a Tcl socket corresponding to a given SciViews socket
client currently connected.
}
\description{
A 'sockclientconn' object is created that opens a connection from R to a
SciViews socket client (that must be currently connected).
